Day 11 just disappeared on me. I had to go to work yesterday and left my macbook at home. I thought it best to focus on work while I am there. Afterwards I went out for drinks with friends and before I knew it, my head hit the pillow and my github and learn streak was crushed!! Ugh! Starting a new streak today. 

I'm only about 68% of the way through HTML & CSS. I still have a goal of completing it this weekend and getting my local environment set up. I've got a flow class at yoga tomorrow morning where this old lady named Sharon basically kicks my ass for an hour. It's always a good reset to get into Sharon's class at the end of a week (or start of a new week? perspective?). But after that class I have the whole day to crush out HTML & CSS. A second screen would be so helpful in this section. Someday...

Last week went by too quickly and I was easily distracted after all of the html and css videos. I should be finished with the section by now. I really want to make more good progress this week. I really gotta put my head down this week.

See ya out there.
