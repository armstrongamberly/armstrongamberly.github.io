I've decided I need to be more consistent with my blog posts. I remember scouting for information on different bootcamps and the finding people who blogged about their experiences was like finding gold. Also, I think there's something really satisfying about publishing experience, progress or frustration to the universe. It makes it real because other people can see it and maybe even relate to it.

I officially received my access on the 7th but I only did the Welcome bit and then savored my last weekend free. I had spent the two weeks before this, just returning from my honeymoon and getting a new colleague (who will be taking my place) up to speed with the business and our team and the workload. I'm working one day a week now, on Fridays. Our team is short staffed and I offered to quit or to work one day a week. A paycheck is nice to have, even if it is a tiny one.

So I really started on July 10th. I started Intro to Ruby without having done much Ruby at all. I think I had done something on CodeAcademy but most of my prep work centered around HTML & CSS and JavaScript. I had read that Ruby was intuitive and easier to understand and use. JavaScript was bulky, wordy--- but also rules the world. It's true, once I started Ruby I remember thinking, "That's it? That's all I have to type?" I struggled near the end of Intro to Ruby when it came time to piece all of the methods of Tic Tac Toe together. And when I thought it was over it came time to convert it to object-oriented.

I find the smaller labs easier to tackle and even though the larger lab was just a combination of all those little labs, I found myself overwhelmed and spending too much time trying to figure it out on my own. I remember spending most of Friday on the Tic Tac Toe lab, finally asked for help, and I literally just needed to change one word in one method. I also fret quite a bit about not mastering a concept before moving on. I'm hoping that there will be lots of ways to practice because I'm constantly looking back at old lessons for reminders.

I set a goal to complete Intro to Ruby by Sunday and just made it. I had to work quite a bit on Saturday and Sunday because Friday really set me back but my wife is also busy with extra tasks from work so we had a work date and that made it not so bad.

I finished Git and Github pretty quickly yesterday - like everything else, I understand it, I just haven't had to DO IT too much yet, so I feel shaky. I started on HTML & CSS and got the idea that maybe it's time to set up a local environment. Nearly 5 hours of updates later, into my evening and morning, I screwed something up at the last minute and Atom was still connected to Learn IDE somehow. I think it can be fixed but I was tired of not making any more progress and resorted back to using the Learn IDE for now. I did a few free courses on HTML & CSS through other websites and was ready to move through some familiar ground. 

I would like to use this space to confess that I am currently obsessed with maintaining my streak on learn and also github. 9 day streak for both right now! Woo!

I also bought some color coded note cards I was thinking about filling out with some terms to keep me from clicking back into old lessons so much. Has anybody else done this and found it to be helpful? Or maybe you have some other study habits that helped? Let me know.

One last update: I've dreamed about Object Oriented Ruby the past 2 nights.


See ya out there!
