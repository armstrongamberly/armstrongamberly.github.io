I had big plans of finishing OOR last week and preparing for first project this past weekend. However, as I stumbled along I decided it was time to slow down and digest the concepts and make sure I was understanding everything I was covering. I've felt a bit of pressure (no one to blame but myself) to move through the program very quickly. Well, I have moved very quickly and I feel that gave me a few extra days to get through OOR. I'm currently 76% of the way there. With that being said, I have a new goal of completing my first project by THIS weekend. That may be a lofty goal because I know close to nothing about the CLI data gem project and there are a few other labs, like Tic Tac Toe with AI, that I need to get through as well. 

The 10th will technically be my 1 month anniversary! Cheers to 1 month of Flatiron School, 1 month of only working 1 day a week, and 1 month of being "the housewife"! While my cooking has not improved at all I am getting better at coding.

Good luck on your week, everyone!

See ya out there!
