I almost forgot about my blog post this week. Where is my brain?? Last Wednesday I passed my first assessment with the CLI data gem project. My project was pretty simple and I liked getting feedback on it. Definitely pumped to keep moving along.

Friday I had to go to work and do that thing. Saturday the wife and I went to Charleston for a birthday weekend (for my wife) and also for some eclipse viewing. It was really amazing to be in the path of totality. We got some cloud cover while we were waiting and then the sun came out just in time for the eclipse action. I had been anticipating this for over a year, so it was very exciting to see and I'm so glad we were able to take some time off and enjoy the weekend.

We got home Monday night and Tuesday I spent the day doing some housework that didn't get done over the weekend. Today I'm back on the grind. It feels like I've been away from my coursework forever even though it's been just a few days. I'm working on finishing up ORMs today because Thursday, I have to go to work. Usually I go into work on Fridays but we are headed to Seattle at 6am on Friday morning for my brother-in-law's wedding this weekend. I doubt any work will happen. Being in the Pacific Northwest in August with family is pretty amazing and I fully plan on enjoying the time we are there. I'm hoping to be starting into the Rack section by next weekend. I'll go ahead and set that goal now so there are no excuses when I get back next Tuesday.

Not a lot else going on. I feel like I've been slacking the past week because of my schedule. Trying to take the time to relax and enjoy it but also pretty excited to keep learning.

See ya out there!
