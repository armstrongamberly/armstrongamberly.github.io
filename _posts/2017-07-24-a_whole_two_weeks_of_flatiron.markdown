A morning blog post to get my goals for the day out there. 

I'm a whole two weeks into the program. 

Thoughts: 

* Ruby and Tic Tac Toe blew my mind and was at times very frustrating. I look back at that week and it feels quick and messy but kind of in a good way.
* HTML and CSS is taking me wayyy longer than I thought it would. I was weary of setting a goal at the beginning of last week because I'm familiar with HTML and CSS but it is a lot of lessons to sit through. I'm regretting not setting a goal earlier in the week.
* I'm hoping that HTML and CSS is one of those things where I don't need memorize evverrytthinng-- just get an understanding of what you CAN do and you can always google later when you need it.
* I am actually looking forward to SQL. It's the one language most related to what I see at work and I kind of thought it would be nice to know but I'm not pumped about it. I actually am sort of looking forward to it now.
* I did not get my local environment set up this weekend. Learn IDE has been kind to me the last few days and for the sake of progress I may just keep it for a few more days.
* My wife was feeling a bit burned out so we didn't have that many work hours this weekend. I was frustrated at first because I had some goals to hit. In the end it was good to take a break and take a long walk with the dogs, watch a show, unwind a bit outside of our computer screens. She thinks we need to commit to having one day off to avoid burn out. We have a new plan to do our weekend work only on Saturday in hopes of taking Sundays off. Motivation.
* Speaking of motivation-- I'd like to go see Dunkirk (in 70mm) this week but no rewards until I make some progress.
* I want to make it through the end of HTML and CSS. I have two labs and then bootstrap section. I think it's a reasonable goal considering Mondays are my house chore days. Last week felt slow compared to my first week. My first week I was moving with a bit of urgency and I'd like to get close to that pace again.
* I'm also going to try and keep a tighter schedule throughout the day. I found my mind wandering a lot last week through HTML and CSS and seeking out distractions between lessons. 
* I still love what I'm doing. I'm still motivated. I do have a pretty big fear of failing miserably or sucking really hard at all of this.
