You guys, for some reason I was super hung up on yield and blocks most of the afternoon. I just couldn't let it go. Maybe I shouldn't have had that extra cup of coffee this morning...

I decided to look for some more reading material about yield and blocks. Searched around the web briefly and found some other explanations(and other confused people) that were just okay. Did some chores...still thinking about it... opened up the book **Learn to Program** by Chris Pine and I flip to the Arrays and Iterators section and don't see anything there. So I'm looking in the back for an index and there on the last page is an example of yield and he's like (I'm paraphrasing) "I don't know why people like using yield but it's important to know that *there is more than one way to do things*."

So I finally sighed with relief. I'm not the only one who thinks yield is weird and there is always more than one way to do something. 

YOU GUYS, I FINALLY SET UP MY LOCAL ENVIRONMENT AND I LOVE IT. Shoutout to Tracy for spending like an hour helping me out. 

I'm getting to the end of Procedural Ruby. I'm hoping to finish it up this weekend and move into Object Oriented Ruby next week. That little blip of OOR at the end of the intro kind of blew my mind. I'm a bit nervous.

See ya out there!
