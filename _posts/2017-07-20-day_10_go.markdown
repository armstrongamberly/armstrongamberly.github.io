It's almost 10pm and I just remembered my goal to keep up my blog.

Had some more issues with the IDE this morning and realized it was pretty much my own fault by the end. I was really frustrated at one point this morning. You know when all those crazy thoughts like, "What are you doing?! Why are you doing this?!" start flooding in. It was only for about 2 minutes but I maintained my cool and made it through. I also feel more committed then ever to set up my local environment this weekend.

Almost completed HTML and CSS through the CSS section. I have the last lab to complete. It seemed like it would take a bit of time so I'm going to save it for tomorrow morning. You know, when there is coffee.

I took a much needed break and went to a restorative yoga class this evening. I need to get to more classes during the week. It's hard to break away from the screen in the middle of the day when I get a good pace going. I always feel so great after yoga though. It's a good reset button.

In summary, despite my issues this morning, it still turned out to be a productive day. I'm still motivated and still excited to see what I'll get into tomorrow.

See ya out there!
