And I missed last weeks blog post. Yeesh! The last two (three?) weeks have been busy. I was out of town for 2 long weekends in a row, then we had Labor Day weekend and it felt great just sitting at home and relaxing for the first time in a while. The activity on my github has reversed from my first month with the program and it's stressing me out!
After I finished my first project I really anticipated finishing SQL and ActiveRecord very quickly but instead (related to the reasons above) I only just finished them yesterday.
Aside from the busy schedule, when I have been going through lessons I have found it very difficult to stay focused. My mind wanders. I complete one lesson and then distract myself for an hour with some random task/thing. Our second trip out of town was a weekend back in Seattle for my brother-in-law's wedding. We had such a great weekend! My wife and I are from the Seattle area and we had been discussing where we plan on living over the next few years. We had been thinking that moving back to Seattle would be the best idea. That weekend back solidified our decision and that set in motion another mental distraction. We most likely won't be leaving Atlanta until the spring but it is exciting and requires a bit of planning.

I finished a few books over the last few weeks and started reading "Thinking, Fast and Slow" by Daniel Kahneman. You may find it humorous that I have even had trouble focusing long enought to read this.
With the bit I've read so far in this book I can tell that I'm distracted and why I'm distracted. What I need to do is re-establish a flow to my day. I had a great flow my first month with the program and I need to recalibrate and focus on the tasks at hand. With the excitement of moving in the spring it's easy to get distracted with the planning but I also need to be ready for a job in the spring! I need to get these skills and learn as much as I can between now and then. I have a goal of finishing the program by January. I'm not totally sure whether that's feasible but I'm still going to work towards that end date. Moving and looking for a job are both still several months away. What I can do right now, is prepare for that future job. That's what my focus needs to be right now.

I have a few things in mind to help me get my mind right for studying and get back into my flow.

1. Getting back to my yoga routine has definitely helped. I can tell that my mind is all over the place and yoga helps me slow down. I added another class to my schedule this week and I'm going to add a mid-week stretch class from now on.

2. Meal planning. We're cutting out blue apron for the next few weeks to save cash and I need to do a better job of planning ahead and getting any shopping done before 10:30am

3. Get Nala and Louie (my dogs) to the dog park every morning. It's right across the street and they are so relaxed after they go. A happy dog is a tired dog. This was also a part of my routine for the first few weeks and I realize that if I miss it or save it for later it throws my whole day into tilt.(and probably theirs as well!)

4. All house chores done on Mondays. All cleaning, laundry and any meals that can be done ahead of time should be done on Monday. In the past Monday's have not been my most productive day for studying BUT getting all of these chores done ahead of time does free up my Tuesday - Thursday for uninterrupted studying. Fridays are my one day a week at work.

5. Get more done on Saturday and Sunday. I've been out of town the last few weekends and Labor Day weekend was spent enjoying the last few summer-like days. BRR!! It was cold this morning at the dog park! What is this weather! I used to be pretty diligent about spending a couple of hours on the weekend and I need to commit that time again. Even just a couple of lessons on each day would make an impact.

I know that these are not study-specific goals but they do help me get my mind right for studying. These are a few of the items I'm going to focus on getting right over the next couple of weeks so I can get back into my productive flow.

See ya out there!
